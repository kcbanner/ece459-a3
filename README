There are two apps here: the original app, in main.cpp, and my test
harness, in test-harness.cpp.  You can generate the Makefile for the
original app using:

qmake-qt -o Makefile nm-morph.pro.

Similarly, you can generate the Makefile for my test harness with:

qmake-qt -o Makefile test-harness.pro.

I've refactored code in the app from the original, which you can find
at http://code.google.com/p/nm-morph.  It's not perfect; I know that
there are some bugs. However, the test harness should not expose them.

If you run the test harness, it will read the files "beaches.jpg" and
"mountains.jpg" and morph them. Your task is to speed up the morphing
algorithm.
